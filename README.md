# Machine Learning Practice Project

The purpose of this project is to examine the predictive performance of different machine learning methods: linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression and random forest on which passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck. The data is obtained from Kaggle competition website [Kaggle _ data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

The data is divided into two parts which are the training part that contains 891 observations [training set](train.csv) and testing part that contains 418 observations [testing set](test.csv). The training set will be used to train the statistical models, and the testing set will be used to assess the performance of the methods on predicting unseen data. To get the accuracy of the predictions, the predicted survival of the 418 passengers must be submitted on Kaggle which contains the true data.
